I'm one of those people that would rather spend way to long writing a nice generalized script to do something rather than just do it by hand in half the time.  Figured I might as well share some of them.  Mostly python3 scripts.  Maybe something else.  Use at your own risk.  


Also, spelling is gonna be rough.  I'm writing this in gedit since it's sittin there staring at me funny.   Also might not be in the most clear headed state of mind.  But hey, so it goes.
